# ðŸ’¤ [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) Config Manager
> [!NOTE]  
> It does not install or uninstall Neovim, it only manages its configuration.

This is my neovim config manager written in python. Works with [my LazyVim](https://github.com/Mathiew82/lazyvim-config) derived configuration.
It is basically used to install, update, uninstall, or reinstall the configuration. Feel free to use it ðŸš€
